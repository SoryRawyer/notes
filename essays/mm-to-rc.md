### On my decision to leave MediaMath and join the Recurse Center
I would like to take some time to think through my decision to leave MediaMath, my decision to apply to and attend the Recurse Center, and the factors that led to both decisions. They can be viewed as two distinct decisions, but ultimately they are linked because I would not be doing the former if it weren’t for the latter. As such, the reasons for the former inform my reasons for the latter, by which I mean my situation at MediaMath led me to find the Recurse Center very appealing. “Very appealing” is understating it. When I read about the Recurse Center — first their social rules, which a coworker had linked to, followed by the rest of their users manual, followed by the rest of their website, followed by a number of blog posts written by people who did a batch — it sounded like everything I wanted. I had evaluated a number of next steps — another software engineering job (data engineering, application development), graduate school — and that search helped clarify what I was really looking for in a next step.

Something about reminding myself about the “craft” of programming.

On Friday, February 16th, I am going to give notice that my last day at MediaMath will be Friday, March 16th. 

Outline:
- Introduction
  - Purpose
    - Examine why I wanted to leave MediaMath, and how I finally managed to feel good about the decision to leave
    - Things that made me unhappy over the last few years
    - By the time I’m done writing, hopefully I’ll have a better sense of how I got to where I am, and what I can do better next time
  - Overview of the essay (what do I really want to say in this essay?)
    - Causes at MediaMath
    - Causes outside of MediaMath
    -  Weaving together those two parts of my life
    - Why I think the Recurse Center is going to help
- Causes at MediaMath
  - Lack of interest in the industry
    - Generally not a fan of advertising and its mission to profile every person
    - This is a problem because I can’t feel passionate about the goal toward which I’m working
    - That lack of passion keeps me from feeling engaged about my work, which keeps me from becoming a better programmer
Causes outside of MediaMath
Feeling that my career takes up too much of my time, and not working to find interests outside of work
At times, feeling like I’m trying to force my career to give meaning to my life
Depression/anxiety
Moving to NYC exacerbated feelings of isolation that developed in Boston
Lack of social structure and fear of trying to create one for myself
Didn’t realize just how much I’d changed my habits to cope with these things, and how much that was hurting me (distraction, lack of focus, fear of failure getting in the way of exploring my curiosity)
Weaving together those two parts of my life
Social anxiety keeping me from engaging with the rest of the company in a productive manner
Becoming somewhat abrasive and less receptive to new ideas
Impostor syndrome
Feeling like my coworkers all secretly hated me and thought I was an idiot
Feeling like my job at an ad-tech company didn’t reconcile with the kind of person I saw myself as
Spending too much time working on things that didn’t interest me (data processing, ad-tech) and too little time getting involved in things I do like (or *could* like) (music, literature, interactive technology, tangible output, ~*creativity*~)
Anecdote about the Emily Dickinson poem project in 7th grade?
Lessons? Conclusions?
