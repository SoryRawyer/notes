### On my decision to leave MediaMath and join the Recurse Center
I would like to take some time to think through my decision to leave MediaMath, my decision to apply to and attend the Recurse Center, and the factors that led to both decisions. They can be viewed as two distinct decisions, but ultimately they are linked because I would not be doing the former if it weren’t for the latter. As such, the reasons for the former inform my reasons for the latter, by which I mean my situation at MediaMath led me to find the Recurse Center very appealing. “Very appealing” is understating it. I had evaluated a number of next steps — another software engineering job (data engineering, application development), graduate school — and that search helped clarify what I was really looking for in a next step. When I read about the Recurse Center — first their social rules, which a coworker had linked to, followed by the rest of their users manual, followed by the rest of their website, followed by a number of blog posts written by people who did a batch — it sounded like everything I wanted.

Part: MediaMath
- Getting to MediaMath
- Analytics team
- Data Platform team
  - the three person team
  - product/project managers rotating in and then leaving
- Data Platform + others
  - now had prodcut managers

Part: Search for something else

Part: Mental Health
- Affect on both work and personal life
- Treatment and post-"major depressive episode" perspective

Part: Recurce Center
- What about it appealed to me
  - Community
  - Other areas of programming
- What I hope happens once I'm there
  - meet interesting techincal people
  - finish any of the programming tasks I've left behind over the years
    - or at least make them into an actual project, instead of a few lines of code I abandoned years ago
  - gain a fresh perspective on programming and my relationship with it
  - Something about reminding myself about the “craft” of programming.

Part: Post-RC (or tangential to RC?)
- Lessons to keep in mind in a future job
  - expand on things I did wrong/traps I let myself fall into from the mental health and MM parts


Outline (going chronologically for lack of a better format):
- Introduction
  - Purpose
    - Examine why I wanted to leave MediaMath, and how I finally managed to feel good about the decision to leave
    - Things that made me unhappy over the last few years
    - By the time I’m done writing, hopefully I’ll have a better sense of how I got to where I am, and what I can do better next time
  - Overview of the essay (what do I really want to say in this essay?)
    - Causes at MediaMath
    - Causes outside of MediaMath
    -  Weaving together those two parts of my life
    - Why I think the Recurse Center is going to help
- Causes at MediaMath
  - Lack of interest in the industry
    - Generally not a fan of advertising and its mission to profile every person
    - This is a problem because I can’t feel passionate about the goal toward which I’m working
    - That lack of passion keeps me from feeling engaged about my work, which keeps me from becoming a better programmer
  - Felt on my own: maintaining/developing services, no mentorship, no career growth
    - Boss told me they didn't have the time to necessary to help me develop my career
    - Senior developer who didn't collaborate with me/I didn't collaborate with him
      - Just two devs and the CTO, so I had to play product/project manager in addition to developing
- Causes outside of MediaMath
  - Feeling that my career takes up too much of my time, and not working to find interests outside of work
  - At times, feeling like I’m trying to force my career to give meaning to my life
  - Depression/anxiety
    - Moving to NYC exacerbated feelings of isolation that developed in Boston
    - Lack of social structure and fear of trying to create one for myself
    - Didn’t realize just how much I’d changed my habits to cope with these things, and how much that was hurting me (distraction, lack of focus, fear of failure getting in the way of exploring my curiosity)
- Weaving together those two parts of my life
  - Social anxiety keeping me from engaging with the rest of the company in a productive manner
    - Becoming somewhat abrasive and less receptive to new ideas
    - Impostor syndrome
    - Feeling like my coworkers all secretly hated me and thought I was an idiot
  - Feeling like my job at an ad-tech company didn’t reconcile with the kind of person I saw myself as
    - Spending too much time working on things that didn’t interest me (data processing, ad-tech) and too little time getting involved in things I do like (or *could* like) (music, literature, interactive technology, tangible output, \~\*creativity\*\~)
- Lessons? Conclusions?
  - Things to look out for/social structures to put in place?
